basically just whatever you sent to the bot is saved locally and then deleted after some time
- your username is not saved
- the message itself is saved
- images are saved as links so the actual file itself isn't saved
- the time the message was sent is saved but only for the purpose of deleting it after some time
- server ids are saved to allow for configuration
- channel ids are saved to allow for configuration
- that's about it
