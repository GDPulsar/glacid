# glacid

okay so basically i'm just really lazy and don't wanna do too complicated things so imma copy paste the info thing and then write a really rudimentry terms of service and privacy policy in other files lmao

Glacid is a Discord bot that takes messages you send to it and adds them to a database, then responds with a random message from the database. Something such as this can cause many a problem. Therefore, I must specify this info tab.
Glacid is able to send you the sorts of things that people would send to it. So by using this bot, you are directly saying that you understand you will be shown things such as:
Pornographic material
Shitposts (this bot already is one)
Disturbing imagery
Other chaos
By talking to this bot, I am not responsible for any mental scarring or other mental damage of any sort. Please understand the risk.

Now for the fun stuff.
Glacid is able to respond to any message in the channels that it has been allowed to access in every guild. (to add a channel, the owner of the guild must use the /channel command)
However, this has certain rules.
1. The message must include the word 'glacid' whether it be in the middle of a word or not.
2. There is a 1/100 chance it decides to respond anyway.
Glacid will then respond with a phrase that is predetermined, and will replace a word in the phrase with a random word from the message you sent. (unless the 1/1000 chance happens, then it chooses a phrase with no replaceable word)
However there is a 1/20 chance that it responds with a message from the database.
Direct messaging glacid will add your message to the database, and respond with a database message.
That means, that given an example of there being 5 NSFW images in the database, and 1000 messages total, there is a 1/100 * 1/20 * 5/1000 chance that a message you send in a glacid-allowed channel will be met with an NSFW image.
(i originally added moderation but people said it would be funnier without it and i honestly agree)

Anyway, have fun using glacid to commit multiple war crimes! (i dont think you can actually)

the above line is a joke i promise
